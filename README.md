# Helper Guy – Presage Emotion Prototype

This project is a small prototype that splits your idea into two pieces:

- A **backend "brain" stub** that simulates Presage analysis.
- A **React-based camera moderator + helper UI** that runs in the browser.

> Important: this repo does **not** include the real Presage SmartSpectra SDK. The backend currently returns mock metrics. Later, you will replace the stub logic with calls into the actual Presage C++ SDK running in WSL2.

## Project layout

- `backend/`
  - `package.json` – Node metadata.
  - `server.js` – simple HTTP server exposing the brain API stub.
- `frontend/`
  - `index.html` – React UI (loaded from CDN) with camera access and helper avatar.

## Backend – brain API stub

The backend is a tiny Node.js HTTP server using only core modules (no external dependencies).

- **Health check**
  - `GET /health`
  - Returns `{ "status": "ok", "message": "Presage brain stub running" }`.

- **Analyze frame**
  - `POST /analyze-frame`
  - Request body (JSON):
    - `image_base64` – **required**, base64-encoded JPEG frame captured from the webcam.
    - `request_id` – optional string, echoed back for tracking.
    - `client_tag` – optional string to identify the caller (e.g. `"helper-ui"`).
  - Response body (JSON):
    - `request_id`
    - `analysis`:
      - `emotion` – `"neutral" | "happy" | "stressed" | "focused" | "tired"` (mocked).
      - `engagement` – number between 0–1.
      - `stress_level` – number between 0–1.
      - `heart_rate_bpm` – integer.
      - `breathing_rate_bpm` – integer.
      - `timestamp` – ISO string.
    - `source`:
      - `kind` – currently `"single_frame"`.
      - `client_tag` – echoed from the request.

### Running the backend locally

1. Install Node.js (any current LTS is fine) so that `node` and `npm` work in your terminal.
2. Open a terminal at the `backend` folder:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install   # currently no deps, but this will prepare node_modules if you add some later
   npm start
   ```

3. The stub server will listen on `http://localhost:5000`.

Later, when you have WSL2 + Ubuntu + Presage SDK:

- Replace the `buildMockAnalysis()` function in `server.js` with a call into your Presage-based analysis service (or move this HTTP layer directly into the Linux side).

## Frontend – React camera moderator + helper UI

The frontend is a single HTML file that:

- Uses `getUserMedia` to open the webcam.
- Every 2 seconds, captures a frame into a hidden `<canvas>`.
- Sends the frame as base64 JPEG to `POST http://localhost:5000/analyze-frame`.
- Displays:
  - A **live camera preview**.
  - A **helper avatar** whose emoji and text react to the latest `emotion`.
  - A **metrics grid** showing engagement, stress, heart rate, and breathing rate.

Because React is loaded via CDN, you do **not** need any build tooling to try the UI.

### Using the frontend

1. Make sure the backend is running on `http://localhost:5000`.
2. Open `frontend/index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome/Edge).
3. Grant camera permission when prompted.
4. You should see:
   - Your camera feed on the left.
   - The helper avatar and metrics on the right, updating every ~2 seconds based on mock data.

If the brain API is not running, you will see a message like:

- “Problem talking to brain API on localhost:5000.”

## Where Presage fits later

This prototype isolates the contracts so you can drop in Presage later:

- **React side (eyes + UI)** will stay almost the same.
- **Backend side (brain)** will change:
  - Instead of `buildMockAnalysis()`, call into a WSL2/Ubuntu service that uses the Presage SmartSpectra C++ SDK to analyze frames.
  - Keep the same JSON shape for the response so the frontend does not care whether the data is mocked or real.

That way, your helper app can start with fake emotion and then “go live” with Presage once your Linux environment and SDK integration are ready.
